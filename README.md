Absolutely! Here's a professional and well-structured `README.md` tailored for your GitHub repository that explains the GraphQL reconnaissance and attack surface presentation (including the use of WebSockets, Nmap, and discovery techniques):

# 🛡️ GraphQL Reconnaissance & Attack Surface Mapping

This repository presents a detailed assessment of a GraphQL endpoint using both passive and active reconnaissance methods. It includes a structured **Gamma pitch deck**, **Nmap discovery techniques**, and **real-time WebSocket enumeration** to identify potential attack surfaces.

## 📑 Overview

- 🔍 Initial service discovery via **Nmap**
- 📂 Enumeration of GraphQL schema types
- 🌐 Identification of **GraphQL over WebSocket** for real-time subscription handling
- 📌 Payload samples for introspection and fuzzing
- 📊 Clean visual slides included for briefings and academic reporting

## 🧪 Tools Used

- **Nmap**  
  With `http-grep` and custom GraphQL patterns to fingerprint endpoints.

- **ffuf**  
  Fast directory/content fuzzing to enumerate GraphQL access points.

- **cURL & Burp Suite**  
  Manual probing of introspection and WebSocket headers.

---

## 🔧 Sample Queries

```bash
curl -X POST https://<target>/graphql \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"query":"{__schema { types { name }}}"}'
```

### WebSocket Subscription (handshake)
```
GET /subscriptions HTTP/1.1
Host: <target>
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
Sec-WebSocket-Key: <key>
```

---

## ⚠️ Attack Surface Highlights

- **Open GraphQL introspection**
- **Accessible WebSocket upgrade over `/subscriptions`**
- **Unprotected query input allows for type & schema mapping**
- **Potential for unauthorized subscriptions**
